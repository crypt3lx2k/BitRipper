Currently under construction, will currently only work on x86 GNU/Linux systems with SSE2 support.
Due to the beautiful setup of the John the Ripper source code it will be easy to extend this to a multitude of platforms.

I eventually intend to create a Python module to
#1 - Easily interface with John the Ripper from Python
#2 - Integrate the DES bit slice technique into DictRipper <https://github.com/crypt3lx2k/DictRipper>


Current compiling is done with
$ gcc bitripper.c john-src/*.[Sc] -O3 -o bitripper -std=c99

And current usage is
$ ./bitripper tripcode wordlist

But these are extremely likely to change in the very near future.
