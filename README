Currently under construction, will currently only work on x86 GNU/Linux systems with SSE2 support.
Due to the beautiful setup of the John the Ripper source code it will be easy to extend this to a multitude of platforms.

I eventually intend to create a Python module to
#1 - Easily interface with John the Ripper from Python
#2 - Integrate the DES bit slice technique into DictRipper <https://github.com/crypt3lx2k/DictRipper>


Current compiling is done with
$ cd src/
$ make
Follow the instructions from there on.
I Had to remove DOS support until I could read some docs.
Something is bound to be broken in the makefile as well since all I did was some very crude and ugly brute surgery, I'll completely rewrite it when I have time.

And current usage is
$ ./bitripper tripcode wordlist

Again, this is likely to change in the near future, I will probably have some kind of file system with targets and hits.

I'm unsure of how git and github handles symbolic links to files, currently I have every unmodified John the Ripper source file in a seperate directory and just symbolic links to them in the general src/ directory.
