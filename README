Currently under construction, the only machine I have access to is an x86-32-sse2 so for now that is all that is supported. Due to the beautiful setup of the John the Ripper source code it will be easy to extend this to a multitude of platforms, and if my surgery on the Makefile was successful, most architectures that are supported by john the ripper is also supported by this program, but there is no way for me to tell right now.

At first I intended to make a Python module out of this, mainly to use with the DictRipper project, now I'm not so sure. The main reason for this is that when it comes to tripcodes pre-computed tables are just so incredibly efficient compared to anything brute force. This might change though, I'm just unsure about it right now.

My current plans for this project is to create an efficient tripcode cracker that runs on clusters, so I might try to use the multi-threading capabilities although first up comes multi-processing.

Current compiling is done with
$ cd src/
$ make
Follow the instructions from there on.

I had to remove DOS support until I can read some docs.
Something is bound to be broken in the makefile as well since all I did was some very crude and ugly brute surgery, I'll completely rewrite it when I have time.

And current usage is
$ ./bitripper tripcode wordlist

Where targetlist is a list of tripcodes (one per line 10 characters long) that you want to crack and wordlist is a list of words (one per line, UNIX, Windows or OS X style newlines are all accepted).

Again, this is likely to change in the near future, I will probably have some kind of file system with targets and hits.
